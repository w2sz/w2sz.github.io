Whether you would like to build radios, climb towers, send data over the air, bounce signals off the moon, send Morse code overseas, participate in contests, hike up mountains and look for radio signals, or just “hang out” on the repeater in the evenings, this is the club for you.</p><p>New FCC restructuring makes it easier than ever to become an amateur radio operator (ham), and new technology makes it increasingly fun and exciting. The club offers training for those with no radio experience, as well as leadership and learning opportunities for those already licensed.</p><h2 id="Ham-Radio"><a href="#Ham-Radio" class="headerlink" title="Ham Radio"></a>Ham Radio</h2><p>Ham radio is a hobby that is easy to get involved in, and will last a lifetime. It is said that there is no place in the continental US where a ham cannot find a repeater. Most communities have clubs as well as repeaters for all levels of amateur operators. In emergencies, hams often provide vital communication services for emergency personnel and citizens. There is no need to purchase your own equipment while still a student. The club equipment will allow you to explore this wonderful hobby without a financial burden.</p><p>W2SZ is a good club for students to be involved with, because of the flexibility of time commitment. While there are always ample opportunities for involvement, studying should always come first. Many student clubs have numerous meetings and required activities which W2SZ does not have. Freshmen and other students who are trying to figure out just how much extra time they have, will find the club to be inviting and relaxed, yet there will be plenty of exciting things to do when boredom strikes.</p><h2 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h2><p><em>Read more about the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C4e0i-0BqlOLd8OZip4y245jioeTXJbz">history</a> and <a href="/post/constitution">constitution</a> of W2SZ.</em></p><p>W2SZ became an ARRL Affiliated Club since November 20, 1951, the 33rd in the Eastern New York section and the 3rd school club in the section.</p></div><script>window.onload=detectors()</script></article></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="flex-container"><div class="footer-text">Powered by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a> & <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/zoeingwingkei/frame/">Frame</a></div></div></div></div></body></html>
