&lt;p&gt;Based on the January&amp;#x2F;February 2023 QEX article of the same name and subsequent ARRL-TAPR conference paper, this presentation discusses and demonstrates a bot, which can be built using as little as an inexpensive SDR antenna, a Raspberry Pi or laptop, and open source Artificial Intelligence&amp;#x2F;Machine Learning software, that can listen to VHF&amp;#x2F;UHF frequencies for amateur radio transmissions and transcribe those transmissions into text. We will discuss and demonstrate potential uses of the transcribed text and the bot generally. The bot can augment anyone’s experience and enjoyment of being on the air, from new operators who may only have their Technician license to seasoned operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PDT: March 26, 2023, 10:00 am&lt;br&gt;UTC: March 26, 2023, 5:00 pm&lt;br&gt;Duration: 1 hour&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SDR Rover Kit project uses off-the-shelf software-defined radio for an 8-band low-power contesting solution under $400. The idea is to keep the system “simple and stupid” by using wideband components. The prototype has been proven effective in lab and field tests. However, it takes additional optimizations to achieve ideal performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to send text and images by just dialing on your HT keypads? Have you ever wondered how the dial tones work? In this talk, we discuss a simple protocol to transfer data using your HTs by encoding information, including text, images, or arbitrary files, into DTMF tones: this minimal yet functioning setup serves as an introduction to modern digital communication systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PREAMBLE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The W2SZ Amateur Radio Club, at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, has been formed as a non-profit student activity under the sponsorship of the Student Union at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at Troy, New York, in order to promote amateur radio activities as defined in Section 97.1 (Basis and Purpose) of the Rules and Regulations of the Federal Communications Commission. This Constitution is hereby approved as its governing law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ARTICLE-I-MEMBERSHIP&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#ARTICLE-I-MEMBERSHIP&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;ARTICLE I: MEMBERSHIP&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;ARTICLE I: MEMBERSHIP&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;SECTION-1-STATEMENTS-OF-AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION-AND-HAZING&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#SECTION-1-STATEMENTS-OF-AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION-AND-HAZING&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;SECTION 1.

It is the policy of the Rensselaer Union, to provide to the maximum extent feasible, equal opportunity to all qualified individuals without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual preference, or handicap for all aspects of club activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. Reckless or intentional endangerment to health or specifically forced consumption of alcohol or other drugs for the purpose of initiation into or affiliation with W2SZ Amateur Radio Club is strictly prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;
