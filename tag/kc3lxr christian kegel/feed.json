Web SSTV can be run entirely offline, and on any platform from Chromebooks to phones, so long as they support JavaScript and Web Audio. By making SSTV readily available on many platforms, we aim to create educational opportunities and introduce more people to STEM and amateur radio.</p>\n<p>Web SSTV is currently hosted at <a href=\"https://ckegel.github.io/Web-SSTV/\">https://ckegel.github.io/Web-SSTV/</a>.
