We will discuss and demonstrate potential uses of the transcribed text and the bot generally. The bot can augment anyone’s experience and enjoyment of being on the air, from new operators who may only have their Technician license to seasoned operators.</p>\n<h2 id=\"SDR-Rover-Kit-The-Next-Generation-Setup-for-Amateur-Radio-Contesting\"><a href=\"#SDR-Rover-Kit-The-Next-Generation-Setup-for-Amateur-Radio-Contesting\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"SDR Rover Kit: The Next Generation Setup for Amateur Radio Contesting\"></a>SDR Rover Kit: The Next Generation Setup for Amateur Radio Contesting</h2><p>Presentors: Zhemin Zhang KD2TAI</p>\n<p>Collateral or Slides:<br><a href=\"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1680919200000/GqyBDGex0u2bd6G_vWPmdA/riGZN7pQfnQqOSdNk61Mtobr_aqofLLPLXVg245NjTIV0CPF6yJexMtBmyuXNoKDzWykBdMYCks-EIn88uhD5mUbjCVQJKkCGNqMycxR-I-OogpvIREIx1zkJwlGq78t-o5W0TgzsfccHiFT4U809Q/M41VPuwTTk2k7MXraiXFPDt3eJNQ2xgtFJISgflmKXU\">SDR Rover Kit - QSO Today March 2023 Zhemin Zhang KD2TAI.pdf</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Level: Intermediate<br>Category: Contesting and DX, Future of Amateur Radio, Homebrew and Construction, Field Operation, SDR Software Defined Radio</p>\n<p>Time:</p>\n<p>PDT: March 26, 2023, 10:00 am<br>UTC: March 26, 2023, 5:00 pm<br>Duration: 1 hour</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The SDR Rover Kit project uses off-the-shelf software-defined radio for an 8-band low-power contesting solution under $400. The idea is to keep the system “simple and stupid” by using wideband components. The prototype has been proven effective in lab and field tests. However, it takes additional optimizations to achieve ideal performance.</p>\n",

Have you ever wondered how the dial tones work? In this talk, we discuss a simple protocol to transfer data using your HTs by encoding information, including text, images, or arbitrary files, into DTMF tones: this minimal yet functioning setup serves as an introduction to modern digital communication systems.</p>\n",
