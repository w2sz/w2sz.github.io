It was a reply postcard that WRPI’s predecessor (WHAZ) mailed to those who sent letters to the station</p>\n<p>Note that RPI’s WHAZ-AM only broadcast on Monday evenings. But, once a month, it transmitted “clear channel” across the entire United  States.</p>\n<p>The bell pictured has an interesting history, as it was used in the very first experiment demonstrating electrical communication in  1831. WHAZ used the bell in several broadcasts.</p>\n<p>I hope this is interesting, and that someone can use this image to post on WRPI’s website</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
