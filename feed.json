Here’s a step-by-step tutorial on how to subscribe to W2SZ using RSS and how to use Feedrabbit service to forward it to emails, if preferred.</p>\n<h2 id=\"RSS\"><a href=\"#RSS\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"RSS\"></a>RSS</h2><h3 id=\"Choose-an-RSS-Reader\"><a href=\"#Choose-an-RSS-Reader\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Choose an RSS Reader\"></a>Choose an RSS Reader</h3><p>To subscribe to W2SZ using RSS, you will need an RSS reader. There are many different RSS readers available, both as desktop applications and web-based services. Some popular options include Thunderbird, Feedly, Inoreader, and NewsBlur. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use Feedly as an example.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Add-the-W2SZ-RSS-Feed-to-your-Reader\"><a href=\"#Add-the-W2SZ-RSS-Feed-to-your-Reader\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Add the W2SZ RSS Feed to your Reader\"></a>Add the W2SZ RSS Feed to your Reader</h3><p>Once you have selected an RSS reader, the next step is to add the W2SZ RSS feed to it. To do this, you will need to find the RSS feed URL for W2SZ. In this case, the RSS feed URL for W2SZ is <strong><a href=\"http://w2sz.github.io/rss.xml\">http://w2sz.github.io/rss.xml</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>In Feedly, for example, you can add the W2SZ RSS feed by clicking on the “Add Content” button and then entering the RSS feed URL into the search bar. Once you have done this, click “Follow” to add the feed to your account.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Email\"><a href=\"#Email\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Email\"></a>Email</h2><p>You can use a service like Feedrabbit to forward the feed to your email address. Feedrabbit is a free web-based service that allows you to receive RSS feeds in your email inbox.</p>\n<p>To get started with Feedrabbit, you will need to create an account on their website. Once you have done this, you can add the W2SZ RSS feed to your account by entering the feed URL into the “Add a Feed” box. After you have added the feed, you can choose to have the feed items delivered to your email address on a real-time, daily, or weekly basis.</p>\n<p>That’s it! By following these steps, you should now be subscribed to the W2SZ RSS feed and receiving updates via email thanks to Feedrabbit.</p>\n",

We will discuss and demonstrate potential uses of the transcribed text and the bot generally. The bot can augment anyone’s experience and enjoyment of being on the air, from new operators who may only have their Technician license to seasoned operators.</p>\n<h2 id=\"SDR-Rover-Kit-The-Next-Generation-Setup-for-Amateur-Radio-Contesting\"><a href=\"#SDR-Rover-Kit-The-Next-Generation-Setup-for-Amateur-Radio-Contesting\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"SDR Rover Kit: The Next Generation Setup for Amateur Radio Contesting\"></a>SDR Rover Kit: The Next Generation Setup for Amateur Radio Contesting</h2><p>Presentors: Zhemin Zhang KD2TAI</p>\n<p>Collateral or Slides:<br><a href=\"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1680919200000/GqyBDGex0u2bd6G_vWPmdA/riGZN7pQfnQqOSdNk61Mtobr_aqofLLPLXVg245NjTIV0CPF6yJexMtBmyuXNoKDzWykBdMYCks-EIn88uhD5mUbjCVQJKkCGNqMycxR-I-OogpvIREIx1zkJwlGq78t-o5W0TgzsfccHiFT4U809Q/M41VPuwTTk2k7MXraiXFPDt3eJNQ2xgtFJISgflmKXU\">SDR Rover Kit - QSO Today March 2023 Zhemin Zhang KD2TAI.pdf</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Level: Intermediate<br>Category: Contesting and DX, Future of Amateur Radio, Homebrew and Construction, Field Operation, SDR Software Defined Radio</p>\n<p>Time:</p>\n<p>PDT: March 26, 2023, 10:00 am<br>UTC: March 26, 2023, 5:00 pm<br>Duration: 1 hour</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The SDR Rover Kit project uses off-the-shelf software-defined radio for an 8-band low-power contesting solution under $400.
