We will discuss and demonstrate potential uses of the transcribed text and the bot generally. The bot can augment anyone’s experience and enjoyment of being on the air, from new operators who may only have their Technician license to seasoned operators.</p>\n<h2 id=\"SDR-Rover-Kit-The-Next-Generation-Setup-for-Amateur-Radio-Contesting\"><a href=\"#SDR-Rover-Kit-The-Next-Generation-Setup-for-Amateur-Radio-Contesting\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"SDR Rover Kit: The Next Generation Setup for Amateur Radio Contesting\"></a>SDR Rover Kit: The Next Generation Setup for Amateur Radio Contesting</h2><p>Presentors: Zhemin Zhang KD2TAI</p>\n<p>Collateral or Slides:<br><a href=\"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/15/15/1680919200000/GqyBDGex0u2bd6G_vWPmdA/riGZN7pQfnQqOSdNk61Mtobr_aqofLLPLXVg245NjTIV0CPF6yJexMtBmyuXNoKDzWykBdMYCks-EIn88uhD5mUbjCVQJKkCGNqMycxR-I-OogpvIREIx1zkJwlGq78t-o5W0TgzsfccHiFT4U809Q/M41VPuwTTk2k7MXraiXFPDt3eJNQ2xgtFJISgflmKXU\">SDR Rover Kit - QSO Today March 2023 Zhemin Zhang KD2TAI.pdf</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Level: Intermediate<br>Category: Contesting and DX, Future of Amateur Radio, Homebrew and Construction, Field Operation, SDR Software Defined Radio</p>\n<p>Time:</p>\n<p>PDT: March 26, 2023, 10:00 am<br>UTC: March 26, 2023, 5:00 pm<br>Duration: 1 hour</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The SDR Rover Kit project uses off-the-shelf software-defined radio for an 8-band low-power contesting solution under $400.

Regular Members. All currently registered “regular” Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute students who have paid the Rensselaer Union full time activity fee and their spouses shall be defined as Regular Members and are eligible for regular membership. (NOTE: “regular” students are monitored by RPI’s Bursar. It denotes a student whose first priority is school and not a job.) Any “regular” student who is registered for both the spring and fall semester previous and following a summer will be eligible to be a member that summer.</p>\n<p>B. Voting Members. All “regular” members of the W2SZ Amateur Radio Club shall be granted voting privileges at the second general meeting after s&#x2F;he becomes a member.</p>\n<p>C. Associate Members. Any person who does not pay an activity fee at Rensselaer, which includes but is not limited to: continuing education, part-time, and degree completion students, RPI faculty, staff, alumni, and their spouses, and students of Russell Sage College and Hudson Valley Community College, shall be eligible for associate membership. Associate Members may participate in all club activities. Associate Members may not vote, hold office, or be regular committee chairpersons except with special approval of The Rensselaer Union Executive Board.</p>\n<p>D. Volunteer Members. Volunteer Members are those who are not eligible to be Regular or Associate Members because they are not with the Rensselaer Union or Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Volunteer Membership must be approved annually by a majority of the Regular Members, including officers, of the club. Volunteer Members must not represent more than five (5%) percent of the total club membership at any time. Volunteer Members may participate in all club activities. Volunteer Members may not vote, hold office, or be regular committee chairpersons except with special approval of the Rensselaer Union Executive Board.</p>\n<p>E. Guests. A member’s guest is allowed to operate at the club station under the supervision of the member; however the member is responsible for the actions of his&#x2F;her guest. A member’s guest may not operate any equipment that the member him&#x2F;herself is not authorized to operate. All guests must also sign the building log upon entry of the station.

The Executive Committee will approve or deny the applicant’s request with a simple majority vote (3&#x2F;5). The Executive Committee will base approval for a key on the said members participation in club activities. Under the same process, The Executive Committee may suspend a key from a member. Upon revocation of a key, or denial of a request for a key, thirty days must pass before the said member may renew his request. A key may not be held, under any circumstance, by anyone other than those who have been specifically authorized by the Executive Committee. If such a key is discovered, it shall immediately be taken by the club, and after review of the situation by the Executive Committee the holder may be reported to the proper authorities.</p>\n<p>B. Operating. Any member shall be allowed to operate any equipment, other than radio transmitters, at the discretion of the Equipment Manager. A member shall be allowed to operate radio transmitters only after s&#x2F;he: (a) demonstrates the ability to operate the equipment properly and in a courteous manner, and (b) after a photocopy of his&#x2F;her Radio Operators License, as issued by the governing agency of the country from which his&#x2F;her license has been issued, has been posted in the appropriate place in the club Station.</p>\n<p>C.
