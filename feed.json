Don’t worry, there are plenty of activities and opportunities available to you as a new ham.</p>\n<p>Getting your ham radio license is just the beginning of a rewarding and exciting journey in the world of amateur radio. There are many different activities and opportunities available to new hams, from making contacts on the air to getting involved in public service. Here are 6 things new hams can do after passing their license exam:</p>\n<h2 id=\"Get-on-the-air\"><a href=\"#Get-on-the-air\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Get on the air\"></a>Get on the air</h2><p>One of the most exciting things about getting your ham radio license is being able to get on the air and start making contacts. Whether you prefer voice, Morse code, or digital modes, there’s a whole world of hams out there waiting to make contact with you.</p>\n<p>There are a few ways to find other hams to contact:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Listen: Start by listening to the bands to get a sense of what’s happening. You can find a list of active frequencies and modes on websites like DX Summit or DX Watch. Listen to different frequencies and modes to see what interests you.</li>\n<li>Join a net: Nets are scheduled gatherings of hams who check in and share information. Joining a net is a great way to meet other hams and practice your communication skills.</li>\n<li>Call CQ: When you’re ready to make your first contact, call CQ (meaning “seek you”) on a frequency where you think other hams may be listening. You can also answer other hams’ CQ calls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you’ve made a contact, be sure to exchange call signs, signal reports, and any other information that’s relevant. You may also want to exchange QSL cards, which are like postcards that confirm your contact. QSL cards are a great way to keep track of your contacts and to make new friends in the ham radio community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Build-your-own-equipment\"><a href=\"#Build-your-own-equipment\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Build your own equipment\"></a>Build your own equipment</h2><p>Building your own equipment can be a fun and rewarding way to explore the technical side of ham radio. There are many kits and projects available that are designed specifically for new hams, so you don’t need to be an expert to get started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Contest\"><a href=\"#Contest\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Contest\"></a>Contest</h2><p>Participating in contests can be a fun and exciting way to test your skills and to make contacts with hams around the world. Whether you’re a casual operator or a serious contester, there are contests to suit all skill levels and interests.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Get-involved-in-public-service\"><a href=\"#Get-involved-in-public-service\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Get involved in public service\"></a>Get involved in public service</h2><p>Getting involved in public service is a great way to use your ham radio skills to help others. Hams can provide communication support for events like marathons, parades, and festivals, or for emergency response efforts like natural disasters or search and rescue operations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Learn-new-skills\"><a href=\"#Learn-new-skills\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Learn new skills\"></a>Learn new skills</h2><p>As a ham operator, you have the opportunity to learn a variety of new skills. Whether it’s learning Morse code, experimenting with digital modes, or building your own equipment, there’s always something new to learn in the world of ham radio.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Share-your-passion\"><a href=\"#Share-your-passion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Share your passion\"></a>Share your passion</h2><p>As a new ham, you have the opportunity to share your passion for ham radio with others. You can introduce your friends and family to the hobby, or get involved in community outreach programs to promote the benefits of ham radio.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, whatever your interests or goals may be, there is something for everyone in the ham radio community. So get out there, explore, and have fun!</p>\n",

The license demonstrates that you have passed an exam that shows you understand the basic concepts of radio communication, regulations, and safety. Here are some important things to know about getting a ham radio license:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Licensing Levels: There are three license levels in the US, known as Technician, General, and Extra. The higher the level, the more privileges you have in terms of the frequencies and modes you can use, as well as the power levels you can transmit with.</li>\n<li>Exam: You must pass a written exam for each license level you wish to obtain. The exam covers topics such as radio theory, regulations, and operating practices. Study guides and practice exams are available online to help you prepare.</li>\n<li>FCC: In the United States, ham radio licenses are issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Once you pass the exam, you can apply for a license through the FCC’s Universal Licensing System (ULS). There is a fee for the exam, and also a fee to apply for the license.</li>\n<li>Call Sign: Once you have your license, you will be assigned a unique call sign that identifies you as a licensed ham operator. The call sign will be used when you transmit on the air.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Getting a ham radio license is not only important for legal reasons, but it is also a valuable way to learn more about radio communication and become part of a vibrant community of amateur radio enthusiasts. So, if you’re interested in getting started with ham radio, consider studying for the exam and obtaining your license.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Obtain-Your-FCC-Reference-Number-FRN\"><a href=\"#Obtain-Your-FCC-Reference-Number-FRN\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Obtain Your FCC Reference Number (FRN)\"></a>Obtain Your FCC Reference Number (FRN)</h2><p>Step 1: Go to the <a href=\"https://apps.fcc.gov/cores/userLogin.do\">FCC Registration System (CORES) website</a>.</p>\n<p>Step 2: Click on the “Register” button on the top right corner of the page.</p>\n<p>Step 3: You will be prompted to create an FCC Username and Password.

Here’s a step-by-step tutorial on how to subscribe to W2SZ using RSS and how to use Feedrabbit service to forward it to emails, if preferred.</p>\n<h2 id=\"RSS\"><a href=\"#RSS\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"RSS\"></a>RSS</h2><p>To subscribe to W2SZ using RSS, you will need an RSS reader. There are many different RSS readers available, both as desktop applications and web-based services. Some popular options include Thunderbird, Feedly, Inoreader, and NewsBlur. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use Thunderbird as an example.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open Thunderbird and select “File” from the top menu.</li>\n<li>Click on “New” and then select “Other Accounts” from the drop-down menu.</li>\n<li>Choose “RSS News &amp; Blogs” and click on “Next”.</li>\n<li>Enter the URL of the RSS feed <strong><a href=\"http://w2sz.github.io/rss.xml\">http://w2sz.github.io/rss.xml</a></strong> and click on “Next”.</li>\n<li>Thunderbird will automatically detect the feed’s title and URL. You can change the title if you want.</li>\n<li>Select the folder where you want to store the RSS feed in Thunderbird. You can create a new folder by clicking on “New Folder”.</li>\n<li>Click on “Finish” to complete the subscription process.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now that you’ve subscribed to the RSS feed, you can access it by clicking on the folder where you saved it in Thunderbird. The feed’s articles will appear in the folder, and you can click on each one to read it.</p>\n<p>If you want to unsubscribe from an RSS feed in Thunderbird, you can simply right-click on the folder and select “Properties”. From there, click on “Unsubscribe” and the folder will be removed from Thunderbird.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Email\"><a href=\"#Email\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Email\"></a>Email</h2><p>You can use a service like Feedrabbit to forward the feed to your email address. Feedrabbit is a free web-based service that allows you to receive RSS feeds in your email inbox.</p>\n<p>To get started with Feedrabbit, you will need to create an account on their website. Once you have done this, you can add the W2SZ RSS feed to your account by entering the feed URL into the “Add a Feed” box. After you have added the feed, you can choose to have the feed items delivered to your email address on a real-time, daily, or weekly basis.</p>\n<p>That’s it! By following these steps, you should now be subscribed to the W2SZ RSS feed and receiving updates via email thanks to Feedrabbit.</p>\n",

We will discuss and demonstrate potential uses of the transcribed text and the bot generally.

Have you ever wondered how the dial tones work? In this talk, we discuss a simple protocol to transfer data using your HTs by encoding information, including text, images, or arbitrary files, into DTMF tones: this minimal yet functioning setup serves as an introduction to modern digital communication systems.</p>\n",
