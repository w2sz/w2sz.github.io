I graduated one semester early, in December ‘76 (class of ‘77), so I probably was not equipment manager for 76-77 school year.  I carried on the traditional report, “Some of the equipment is working, and some of it isn’t”, that my predecessor passed down to me!  I can’t remember his name.  :-(</p>\n<p>At the time, I was WB2PWS (advanced class).  I let my license drop after college, just got re-licensed in late 2018 as Extra, back on the air in 2020 … built Softrock RXTX Ensemble kit, been happily QRP CW ever since … largely contesting!</p>\n",
